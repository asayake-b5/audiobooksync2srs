* Audiobook To SRS

Turn your m4b + srt into an anki deck.

Faster than subs2srs by a factor of ~10 (truly ðŸš€ingfast) because of optimizations that stems from audiobooks not being anime.

Will also give more reliable output (subitle end times are modified to move closer to the next line's start line, as some subs sometimes have 10s gaps in them).
